Telling stories with data
================
PWYP Workshop in Oslo, November 18th 2014


### Assignment

Find a story. Use a tool such as Datawrapper or Infogram to make one or more charts that tell this story. Complement the chart with a tweet length intro text. 

These are some of the questions you could try to answer:

- How did oil change country X (eg. Timor Leste or Equatorial Guinea)? Pick a country that discovered oil relatively recently. Get data from World Bank and compare development indicators before and after the discovery of oil.
- Do governments benefit from oil? Answering this question comprehensively is difficult, but this RGI report provide some clues and case studies.
- Oil and corruption. How do the most oil dependent country rank on corruption and governance in international benchmarks. Get data from the [´workshop_data.xlsx´]() file.
